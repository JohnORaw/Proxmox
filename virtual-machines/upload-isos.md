# Upload ISOs

A generic system has two storage areas. The volume **local** already has a folder for ISOs and is 41% full on my system.

The volume **local-lvm** expects VMs and Containers to be stored and is empty.

I am going to use Ubuntu 22.04 server for my test VMs, I'll upload the ISO file now.

I could also download directly from a URL.
